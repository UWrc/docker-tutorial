# Docker Containers Tutorial

December 2025: A two hour workshop on Docker sponsored by UWIT Research Computing. 

- [DOCKER_CONCEPTS_QA.md](./DOCKER_CONCEPTS_QA.md) is a "Q&A" format view of Docker containerization
- [DOCKER_WORKSHOP_REFERENCE.md](./DOCKER_WORKSHOP_REFERENCE.md) concerns docker commands and workflows
- [WORKSHOP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./WORKSHOP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) contains commands for the five lab activities
- [DockerContainerWorkshop.pdf](./DockerContainerWorkshop.pdf) is the slide deck
- `prime-checker` is a project folder: For creating a Container that evaluates integers as prime / not-prime
- `prime-frontend` is a related project folder: The resulting Container is a web app
- `resnet-classifier` is an image classifier built on resnet-50
    - **WARNING** in practice the resnet-classifier did not work for many students
    - ...so it needs some testing and bulletproofing and debugging...
